# Pokédex

This repository is a template for a Pokédex application. It contains a server-side
REST API built using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com) and a client-side single-page
application built in [Angular](https://angular.dev).

## Prerequisites
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/27.1/)

## Run
In project root directory, run :
```shell
docker compose up
```
Both the API and app will rebuild as changes are made to them.
